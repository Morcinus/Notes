# Coding interview

*Can you tell me a little about yourself?*
I have always loved math and physics, I was great at it - I used to come up with three solutions to a problem and wanted to present all of them. About 5 yearas ago I first came across programming, it was HTML so not really, but quickly I learnt to code in C++ and enjoyed it ever since. Apart from programming, I run a lot, since it allows me to break up the mind-intensive coding sessions.

*How did you hear about the position?*
I saw an advert in university, looked up the job and was happy to find out it was what I am searching after.

*What are your greatest professional strengths?*
Everyone describes me as a highly inteligent individual. I have always excelled at logical thinking and solving difficult problems. I have some sort of insight into the problems which allows me to spot the logical relationships between the individual elements. Thanks to this, I see the entire problem in the big picture and I can take a systematical approach to figure out the solution.

*What do you consider to be your weaknesses?*
I pay a lot of attention to details, however, sometimes I spend too much time on insignificant stuff. I try to overcome this by taking a break after 10 or 15 minutes, where I tell myself whether the problem is worth tackling, or whether I should take a different approach, or even move on.

*What is your greatest professional achievement?*
While working for People in Need, I was supposed to create a program which would read an Excel table and fill the information into a database. At first, it seemed intimidating, since I had to parse information only a human could understand, usually with spelling typos, and decide what to do based on this. In the end, I was very happy with the result, since it accomplished the task perfectly, in no time at all and with less errors than a human.

*Tell me about a challenge or conflict you've faced at school or work, and how you dealt with it.*
- I try my best to avoid conflicts in the first place. (*How?* I do not force others into doing what they don't like. Before anything, I try to look through the eyes of the other person and figure out, whether I wouldn't actually object, too.) I really don't have to handle conflicts that often, one which comes to mind is when my job was to create around two thousand Excel files, each with 12 sheets, and print every single one. I objected to this, since it would require 10 000 sheets of paper to be printed, which seemed completely unreasonable. Fortunately, the employer admitted that having all the files stored electronically is enough.
- While working on the H2AC project, we faced a serious challenge as our model got destroyed the evening before the race. We didn't hesitate, I and one other friend stayed awake overnight and we created a new one, so that we were all ready on the race day.

*Where do you see yourself in five years?*
In five years, I will be about finished with college, so I will be switching to a full-time job. I would love to be already known for what I do among the businesses for which I will be developing the software.

*What is your dream job?*
I would love to be a software architect in the aformentioned field.

*Can you describe a time you disagreed with a decision that was made at school or at work? How did you handle the situation?*
Together with a group of friends, we were looking for a low-budget accomodation in Stockholm during our holidays. They decided to stay in the city, however, that proved to be pretty expensive. I had a feeling that accomodation just outside the city would prove much cheaper, so I offered to look into it and sure enough, I found one for half the price.
